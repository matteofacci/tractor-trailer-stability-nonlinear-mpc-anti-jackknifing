# tractor-trailer-stability-nonlinear-mpc-anti-jackknifing
This repository contains the implementation of a Nonlinear Anti-Jackknifing Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for enhancing stability in tractor-trailer systems. The MPC algorithm ensures precise trajectory tracking and mitigates the risk of dangerous jackknife accidents.
